# Test Case Prioritization for Payment Gateway Integration

## Prioritization Criteria
1. **Business Criticality**: Test cases that involve critical business flows (e.g., successful payment transactions, refunds) are given the highest priority.
2. **Risk**: High-risk areas such as transaction failures or data leaks.
3. **Frequency of Use**: Prioritize test cases for common payment methods like credit cards.
4. **Complexity**: More complex features like handling API timeouts will be tested earlier to identify issues sooner.

## Changes in Requirements
- Reassess high-priority test cases when there are requirement changes, especially those that impact user flows or third-party API behavior.
- Ensure regression tests are executed to confirm no adverse effects on existing features.

## Communication
- Regular updates will be shared with stakeholders via sprint reports, highlighting any adjustments in test priorities.
