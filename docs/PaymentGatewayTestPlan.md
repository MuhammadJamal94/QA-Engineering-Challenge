## Overview

The purpose of this test plan is to validate the integration of a third-party payment gateway into the e-commerce platform. The scope includes functional testing, security validation, and performance checks.

## Objectives

-  **Verify Payment Processing**: Ensure that payments are processed successfully and that all payment methods work as intended.

-  **Security Compliance**: Ensure the system complies with PCI DSS and other relevant regulations to protect user data.

-  **User Experience**: Test the user journey during the checkout process to ensure a seamless experience.

## Scope

### In-Scope

-  **Functional Testing**:

- **Successful payment transactions** using various payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.).

- **Handling of failed payment attempts** due to insufficient funds, invalid card details, etc.

- **Refund process verification** to ensure it operates smoothly and users receive their money back.

-  **Non-Functional Testing**:

-  **Performance Testing**: Measure response times during peak loads and ensure the system can handle concurrent transactions.

-  **Security Testing**: Validate encryption of sensitive data and check for vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection).

### Out-of-Scope

- Full penetration testing (handled separately by security teams).

- Third-party system integrations outside of the payment gateway.
  
## Test Cases

1.  **Successful Payment**:

- Validate that a user can complete a payment with valid credit card details.

- Verify that all confirmation emails are sent correctly.

2.  **Failed Payment**:

- Check error message appears in case of using expired card. 

- Ensure that users can retry a failed transaction without data loss.

3.  **Refund Process**:

- Test the refund process for various payment methods.

- Validate that the user receives a confirmation for the refund.

## Environment

- Testing will be performed in the **staging/testing** environment, using sandbox API keys to simulate transactions. Ensure that the environment mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.

## Tools

-  **Playwright**: For UI and API test automation.

-  **Postman**: For manual API testing and validation of API responses during the initial integration phase.

## Handling Changes in Requirements

- When requirements change, the testing team will:

- Reassess the priority of existing test cases, particularly those related to new payment methods or altered user flows.

- Conduct impact analysis to determine which tests need to be added, modified, or deprecated.

- Update documentation accordingly to reflect changes in scope and approach.

- Ensure regression tests are executed to confirm that existing functionality remains unaffected by new changes.

## Communication with Stakeholders

- Regular updates will be shared with stakeholders via sprint reports, highlighting any adjustments in test priorities, test case statuses, and overall project progress.

- Important discussions regarding changes in requirements will be documented and communicated in a timely manner to ensure alignment among all team members.
